# douchebag_brainwaves

[Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(computer_programmer)) is a busy man. When I saw [how many documents](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) are posted on his website under the heading "Essays," I thought, "Wow! This here entrepreneur sits down and writes out a screed every single time he has a brainwave! And they're all so insightful and well-written, too!" But then I remembered again how busy he is, and I started to worry that he didn't have the time to have as many brainwaves as the world would benefit from him having, so I trained a Python script on his existing corpus of brilliance and use it to crank out new brainwaves for the benefit of the whole world. You can read these brainwaves at [https://douchebagbrainwaves.tumblr.com/](DouchebagBrainwaves.tumblr.com).
